# C programming Assignment 1

This project reads all of the words from an input text file and saves them to a simple binary tree. Each function that manipulates the tree is recursive and uses Structs called Noders. Calling the read function reads each word from the file and automatically adds it to the tree. Calling the report function reports each of the words in the input file in alphabetical order to an output file. It also lists the number of times a particular word appears (which is a variable owned by each node of the tree). Before the program exits, the tree structure is deleted and the memory is freed.
